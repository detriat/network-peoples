      "body": "Tens of thousands of people die from snake bites worldwide every year. Lack of treatment and even the wrong medicine mean many of these deaths are preventable.Snake bites may not strike you as being a major public health problem.But in some parts of the world they are a daily risk, and can be lethal or life-changing.Victims often do not get the treatment they need in time, if at all.In other cases, they are given medicine to treat an injury caused by a different snake.About 11,000 people a month are thought to die from venomous snakebites - similar to the number that died during the whole of the 2014-16 West Africa Ebola crises.A further 450,000 people a year are thought to suffer life-changing injuries such as amputation and permanent disability.The scale of the problem means snake bites are now classed as a priority neglected tropical disease.",

      "body": "Stargazers have been scanning the skies for sightings of a highly unusual lunar eclipse, which began on Sunday night.During the spectacle, known as a 'super blood wolf moon', the moon appears to glow red while seeming brighter and closer to Earth than normal.The event was initially visible from North and South America, as well as areas of western Europe. In parts of the UK some clouds obscured the view.The next total lunar eclipse is expected in two years, on 26 May 2021.Skywatchers see 'super blood wolf moon' A little bit of sunlight is refracted by the Earth's atmosphere and reaches the Moon, bending around the edges of the Earth,' says Walter Freeman, an assistant teaching professor at Syracuse University in New York state.'This small amount of red light still illuminates the Moon enough for us to see it.'",
